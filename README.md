ðŸš€ Excited to share that I have successfully completed an end-to-end DevOps project! ðŸš€

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the project:

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights:
- Java Application Development: Developed and pushed a Java application to a GitHub repository.
- Infrastructure as Code: Leveraged Terraform to create a robust infrastructure, setting up both Master and Worker nodes.
 - Master Node Setup: Installed essential applications including Java, Maven, Docker, and Jenkins.
 - Worker Node Setup: Installed Docker and Kubernetes.

ðŸ“Œ CI/CD Pipelines:
1. Continuous Integration (CI):
 - Triggered by Jenkins: Pulls code from GitHub.
 - Build Process: Utilizes Maven to build the application.
 - Docker Integration: Builds Docker images and pushes them to DockerHub.

2. Continuous Delivery (CD):
 - Automated Deployment: Worker node pulls Docker images from DockerHub.
 - Approval Workflow: Requests for approval before deployment.
 - Kubernetes Deployment: Deploys the application to the Kubernetes server seamlessly.

This project was an incredible learning experience, enhancing my skills in Terraform, CI/CD processes, and container orchestration with Kubernetes.

A huge shoutout to everyone who supported and guided me through this journey! ðŸ™Œ

Looking forward to leveraging these skills in future projects and contributing to more innovative solutions.
